## 🚀 Features
- 🌍 **AI-based Image Classification** - Identifies plant diseases using a trained deep learning model.
- 🎯 **High Accuracy** - Powered by a CNN model trained on a plant disease dataset.
- 📸 **Image Upload Support** - Users can upload an image of a plant leaf for instant diagnosis.
- 📊 **Prediction Confidence Scores** - Shows the probability of different disease classes.
- 🖥️ **Streamlit Web UI** - Simple and interactive UI for easy access.
- 💾 **Lightweight & Efficient** - Designed for quick and accurate predictions.

## 📦 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/afeef-shaikh/Plant-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Plant-Disease-Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Download the Model
Since GitHub does not allow large files, download the trained model manually:  
🔗 [**Google Drive Link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJr1kCEng9nliGRWdAK2fanyxw6V9iPP/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, **move the file** to the correct location:
```sh
mv ~/Downloads/plant_disease_prediction_model.h5 app/trained_model/
```

### 5️⃣ Run the App
```sh
streamlit run app/main.py
```

🚀 Open **`http://localhost:8501`** in your browser and start predicting plant diseases!

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **User Uploads an Image** 🌿  
   - Upload an image of a plant leaf.
2. **Model Preprocesses the Image** 🖼️  
   - Resizes and normalizes the image.
3. **Deep Learning Model Predicts Disease** 🤖  
   - Uses a trained CNN model.
4. **Results Are Displayed** 📊  
   - Shows the detected disease name and confidence scores.
